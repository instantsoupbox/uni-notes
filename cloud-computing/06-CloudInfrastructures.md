# 06 Cloud Infrastructures

## Cloud Monitoring
* Provide high level information in a simple and graphical representation of the cloud status
* Usage:
    * Keep track on utilization
    * Over/under utilization
    * Enable dynamic adaptation to changing work load
    * Identification of bottlenecks and improvements of efficiency
    * Documentation of SLA status

## Monolithic and Microservice Architecture

### Monolithic Architectures
* Layered / multitier architectures
* Strict interfaces between tiers, tight coupling within tiers
* Clear testing and deployment process

### Microservice Architectures
* Each microservice encapsulares simpler business functionality
* Individual process of versioning, testing, deployment and scaling
* Complex deployment and versioning of entire application
* Increased network traffic and latency sensitivity
