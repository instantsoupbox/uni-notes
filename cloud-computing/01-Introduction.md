# 01 - INTRODUCTION

## Cloud Computing According to NIST
* Model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient and on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources (e.g. network, storage, servers, applications, services). 
* The resources can be provisioued and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
* **5 essential characteristics**:
    1. On-demand self service
    2. Broad network access
    3. Resource pooling
    4. Rapid elasticity
    5. Measured service
* **3 service models**:
None of the models grant any privilege over the underlying cloud infrastructures (to a certain degree only IaaS). 
    1. IaaS
        * offers: computing resources
        * grants: deployment, running of arbitrary software, control over `{ OS, storage, deployed applications, networking components }`
    2. PaaS
        * offers: packaged IT capability
        * grants: (control over) application deployment
    3. SaaS
        * offers: consumer / industrial applications
        * grants: no control over individual application capabilities (!)
* **Deployment models**:
    1. Public cloud
    2. Community cloud
    3. Private cloud
    4. Hybrid cloud

### 5 Essential Characteristics
1. On-demand self-service
    * A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities (compute, network, storage) as needed without requiring human interaction with the service provider.
2. Broad network access
    * Capabilities are available over network and accessible by all kinds of platforms (mobile, tablet, desktop).
3. Resource pooling
    * Provider resources are pooled to serve multiple customers, are dynamicaly assigned and reassigned according to demand. Customer is not aware of exact location of provided resources.
4. Rapid elasticity
    * Elastic (maybe even automatic) provisioning and releasing of capabilities for rapid outward and inward scaling according to demand. 
5. Measured service
    * Automatic `{ monitoring, controlling, reporting, optimization }` of resource usage by cloud systems to provide transparency for provider and consumer.
