## Grid Computing 
* Loosely coupled distributed supercomputers that perform very large tasks
* Virtual supercomputers loosely coupled to perform very large tasks
* Complete computers connected to a network, i.e. over the internet
* Connection is not high speed --> unsuited for parallel applications with necessity of communication between different processors

## P2P
* Distributed application architecture that partitions tasks of workloads between peers.
* The **peers** (= nodes) are equally priviledged, equipotent, they are both client and servers. They form an **overlay network** (meaning that this network is built on top of another network, i.e. running on top of the internet).
* Exemplary applications:
    * Distributed file sharing
    * Collaborative networking
    * Throughput computing

## Cloud Computing
* Infrastructure is centralized
